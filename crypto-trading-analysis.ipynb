    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This study investigates trade direction and market impact in a live cryptocurrency strategy. While trade direction is moderately predictable, the analysis finds no strong evidence of market impact. Instead, it reveals a behavioral pattern, particularly in Sell timing, that could be refined to improve the strategy’s execution and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation  \n",
    "This project examines how a cryptocurrency trading strategy decides when to buy or sell, and whether those decisions influence market prices. Using detailed trading (`fills_data`) and market (`market_data`) data, the study aims to identify what drives these decisions and their broader market impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on two research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trading behavior: Can I predict whether the next trade will be a Buy or Sell? I approach this as a classification problem, modeling trade direction and examining which features most influence the strategy’s decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Market Impact: Do these trades affect prices? Using permutation tests, I assess whether trades, especially those that provide liquidity, lead to meaningful price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project contributes to ongoing efforts to better understand how algorithmic trading strategies work and their effects on financial markets. Informed by my internship experience, I apply a structured, data-driven approach to examine decision drivers and potential market influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Buy and Sell trades were found to be moderately predictable using engineered features. While logistic regression was the most accurate model (66.3 percent accuracy, 66.8 percent balanced accuracy, Kappa 0.33), it showed a clear bias toward predicting Sell trades (classification bias: 0.318, F1 score: 0.609). Gradient boosting performed slightly worse in accuracy (65.4 percent) but achieved the highest F1 score (0.669) and the lowest classification bias (0.047), making it the most balanced model overall. Across all models, `deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1_diff` consistently ranked as the most important feature. Tree-based models also highlighted `trade_pnl_lag1`, `fill_qty`, and `volatility_lag1` as key predictors, while downweighting price features like `fill_prc` and `deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1`. SVM and KNN emphasized similar signals but underperformed in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maker trades are followed by significant upward price movement (mean = 0.525, p < 0.001), while Taker trades show no effect (mean = –0.406, p = 0.131). This is driven entirely by Maker Sell trades (mean = 0.800, p < 0.001); Maker Buy trades are not significant (p = 0.080). The price moves against the trade, not with it, indicating no market impact. Instead, the results suggest poor timing on Maker Sell trades, where the strategy exits just before prices rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution to the Discussion  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study contributes to ongoing discussions on algorithmic trading by showing that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature engineering had a greater impact than model choice in predicting trade direction, highlighting the importance of domain-specific inputs and supporting a shift toward data-driven approaches guided by market insight and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This study extends the discussion on algorithmic trading fairness by showing that neither Maker nor Taker trades exhibit evidence of market impact. Instead, the observed price movements following Maker trades reflect poor Sell timing. This shifts the focus away from fairness concerns toward opportunities for improving execution and decision-making logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call to Action  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study shows that the strategy behavior is only moderately predictable. Furthermore, while the results show that the trading strategy does not exhibit market impact, Maker Sell trades often occur just before prices rise, suggesting issues with execution timing rather than price influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these findings, two recommendations emerge for improving the strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorporate richer market context into the dataset: Practitioners should consider expanding the dataset with additional external signals, such as market indexes, more detailed order book data, or macroeconomic indicators. Collecting more detailed order book, trade, and market data will support the development of more expressive features and enable more accurate modeling of the strategy’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Focus on execution quality, especially for Maker Sell decisions: The analysis highlights that Maker Sell trades are often poorly timed, with prices rising shortly after the strategy exits. This suggests that the logic used to determine when to exit positions requires closer examination. Enhancing execution timing could lead to better responses to market conditions and greater profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- This study is based on a limited set of features. Without richer market context such as order book depth or external signals, the analysis may not fully capture the factors behind trade decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analysis focuses on a single strategy operating in one market. Results may not generalize to other conditions. Comparing this strategy across multiple markets could offer further insight or reveal consistent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Expanding the dataset to include order book snapshots, queue position, and broader market indicators would support more effective feature engineering. This could uncover deeper patterns behind trade behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future work could explore models that better capture dynamic, non-linear, and temporal effects, such as attention-based networks or sequence models. These approaches may provide deeper insights into the decision-making process behind trade direction by accounting for how recent market history influences strategy behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation) and PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) methods can help interpret how each feature influences model predictions. Using these tools across all predictors verifies expected behavior and strengthens the interpretability of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given that Maker Sell trades are followed by consistent price increases, future work should develop tools to evaluate and monitor the timing of trade decisions. Rather than market impact, the results suggest poor Sell-side timing. Developing diagnostic tools to flag missed opportunities could help refine the strategy and reduce inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the strategy across multiple markets to assess generalizability and identify consistent behavioral patterns beyond the current single-market analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "The selected features capture market conditions, inventory dynamics, and trade characteristics, while ensuring the model uses only information available before each trade to avoid forward-looking bias. Volatility, calculated as the rolling standard deviation of mid price over a 20-period window, reflects recent market instability and is used in lagged form (`volatility_lag1`). Spread, which is the difference between the best ask and bid prices, captures market tightness and liquidity; a narrow spread suggests an active market, while a wider spread indicates uncertainty.

Lagged PnL metrics (`trade_pnl_lag1`, `cumulative_pnl_lag1`) and inventory (`balance_lag1`) help incorporate the strategy's recent trading state. To capture short-term changes in behavior, I compute the deviation of inventory from its long-run mean (`deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1`), and then take the first difference over time (`deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1_diff`). Similarly, I calculate the deviation of mid price from its long-run mean (`deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1`), followed by its first difference (`deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1_diff`) to reflect recent price shifts. All lagging is applied to avoid introducing forward-looking information. Furthermore, I convert `liquidity_Taker` to numeric so I can easily include it in RFE and L1 regularisation.\n",

    "The SVM model achieved 61.8 percent accuracy, 61.4 percent balanced accuracy, and a Kappa of 0.23. While it showed strong sensitivity (72.3 percent), it suffered from low specificity (50.6 percent), indicating a tendency to overpredict Buy trades. The significant McNemar’s test (p = 0.0061) confirms this imbalance in classification. The F1 score was 0.661, reflecting a relatively good balance between precision and recall despite the skewed predictions. However, this was still lower than GBM’s F1 score of 0.669 and only slightly better than logistic regression’s F1 score of 0.609. Overall, compared to logistic regression, GBM, and Random Forest, SVM underperformed across most evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shortfall likely stems from several factors. First, if the kernel or hyperparameters (C and gamma) are suboptimal, the SVM may have learned a coarse decision boundary, failing to capture non-linear trade dynamics. Second, SVMs maximize margin without accounting for classification bias by default, which can push the boundary toward the minority class, explaining the high sensitivity and low specificity. Third, SVMs are sensitive to feature scale and do not naturally model interactions, whereas tree-based models handle both effectively. Lastly, unlike GBM and random forest, SVM lacks an ensemble mechanism, limiting its ability to detect rare or subtle Buy signals scattered across the feature space.\n",

    "Across all models, `deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1_diff` consistently ranked as the most important feature, reinforcing its central role in predicting trade direction. This feature captures deviations in inventory behavior and appears to be the most informative signal across both linear and non-linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting and Random Forest also emphasized features such as `trade_pnl_lag1`, `fill_qty`, and `volatility_lag1`, suggesting that recent trading outcomes, execution size, and market volatility provide meaningful non-linear signals for classifying trades, while assigning little importance to price-related features. SVM and KNN reflected similar patterns. H2O AutoML followed a comparable trend, placing the most weight on execution-driven and performance-driven signals while assigning less importance to price features like `fill_prc` and `deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1.` \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, logistic regression placed greater emphasis on `fill_prc` and `deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1`, features downweighted by other models, while underweighting key signals such as `trade_pnl_lag1` and `volatility_lag1`. This likely stems from its linear structure, which limits its ability to capture interactions or threshold effects, leading to a heavier reliance on simple, price-based relationships, giving rise to its bias in predicting Sell trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these results directly address the research question: Can I predict whether the next trade will be a Buy or Sell? Trade direction appears to be moderately predictable using well-engineered features. Among all models evaluated, GBM provided the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and achieved the highest F1 score, making it the most suitable model for this classification task. Across models, `deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1_diff` consistently emerged as the most important feature, reinforcing its central role in driving trade decisions. In contrast, features like `deviation_from_mean_mid_price_lag1` and `fill_prc` were consistently downweighted and often contributed to classification bias, suggesting they may be less relevant for modeling trade direction. Overall, the findings indicate that while not perfectly predictable, trade direction can be modeled with moderate success.\n",

    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "While current models demonstrate that trade direction is moderately predictable using static features, future work could enhance performance by incorporating more expressive market signals.

    "\n",
    "In addition, rolling indicators, like short-term volatility regimes or moving averages, could help capture evolving market states. To model temporal dependencies more effectively, sequential approaches such as RNNs or attention-based architectures may uncover dynamic decision-making patterns that static models overlook. These directions could provide a more complete understanding of the strategy’s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, applying interpretation tools like ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation) and PDP (Partial Dependence Plot) can help visualize how each feature affects predictions. This supports validation of model behavior and improves our ability to explain and trust the decisions made by the model.\n",

    "The results show that Maker Buy trades had an average post-trade price change of +0.270 (p = 0.080), which is not statistically significant. This means the observed upward movement could be due to random variation rather than a systematic effect. In contrast, Maker Sell trades had a much larger and statistically significant average price change of +0.800 (p < 0.001), with a 95% confidence interval that clearly excludes zero. This indicates a strong and consistent upward movement in price after Sell trades are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the overall data show that Maker trades are followed by upward price movement, a closer breakdown reveals that this effect is driven entirely by Maker Sell trades. In these cases, the price rises after the strategy sells. This is important because it means the price is moving against the direction of the trade, not with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the strategy were impacting the market by pushing prices in the direction of its trades, we would expect the price to go up after Buy trades and down after Sell trades. In other words, Buy orders would absorb liquidity and lead to upward price movement, while Sell orders would create selling pressure and push prices lower. However, the opposite is observed here, which is that prices tend to rise after the strategy sells. This suggests there is no meaningful market impact from these trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the results point to a limitation in how the strategy times its Sell decisions. The fact that prices increase after Sell trades implies that the strategy often exits positions just before a favorable price move, missing out on potential gains. Because this post-trade movement goes against the goal of the trade, we can conclude that the observed price changes are not a result of the trades themselves. Rather, they reflect missed opportunities and poor timing when selling. This indicates that the strategy lacks predictive ability when placing Maker Sell trades and may benefit from more refined decision rules for exiting positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, while Maker trades appear to be followed by upward price movement, a deeper analysis shows this effect is driven entirely by Maker Sell trades, where prices rise after the strategy sells. Maker Buy and Taker trades showed no significant impact. This indicates that the price changes are not caused by the trades themselves but reflect the market conditions the strategy fails to anticipate. Therefore, the answer to the research question is no: these trades do not appear to affect prices in a systematic way. The observed effects are better explained by poor timing, especially on the Sell side, rather than by market impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Maker Sell trades are consistently followed by price increases, future work should focus on evaluating and improving the timing of Sell decisions. This could involve developing diagnostic tools to detect patterns where the strategy exits positions prematurely, missing favorable price movements. By identifying such missed opportunities, the strategy can be refined to hold positions longer when appropriate, reducing inefficiencies and potentially improving overall performance. Additionally, incorporating short-term predictive indicators or market context features may help enhance the strategy’s responsiveness and timing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examined how a live cryptocurrency trading strategy decides when to buy or sell, and whether those decisions influence market prices. The first research question asked whether trade direction could be predicted. The results showed that trade direction is moderately predictable using engineered features. Among the models tested, gradient boosting offered the best trade-off between accuracy and classification bias, identifying `trade_pnl_lag1`, `fill_qty`, and `deviation_from_mean_balance_lag1_diff` as key predictors. While logistic regression achieved the highest overall accuracy, it consistently favored predicting Sell trades, resulting in classification bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second research question asked whether the strategy’s trades affect prices. The analysis found no evidence of systematic market impact. Although Maker trades were followed by upward price movements on average, this effect was entirely driven by Maker Sell trades, where prices rose after the strategy exited. Maker Buy and Taker trades showed no significant effects. This pattern suggests the strategy is not influencing the market, but rather mistiming its Maker Sell decisions. Instead of causing price movements, the strategy often exits just before favorable changes, missing out on gains. This points to a weakness in how Maker Sell trades are timed under the current trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study also has limitations. The dataset lacked detailed order book information and broader contextual signals, which constrained the depth of feature engineering. Moving forward, expanding the dataset to include richer market and contextual features, such as order book snapshots, trading indicators, and macroeconomic variables, would enable more expressive feature construction and potentially improve model performance and interpretability. Additionally, the analysis focused on a single strategy operating in one market. As a result, the findings may not generalize to other market conditions. Comparing this strategy across multiple markets could offer further insight or reveal consistent behavioral patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could also explore longer time horizons and incorporate dynamic models such as recurrent neural networks or attention-based architectures to better capture temporal dependencies in trade behavior. In parallel, improving execution quality remains a key priority, particularly for Maker Sell trades, where the strategy often exits just before prices rise. Refining Sell-side execution using enhanced decision signals could lead to more effective trade timing and overall strategy improvement. Finally, applying interpretation tools such as ICE and PDP may offer deeper insights into model behavior and support more transparent decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project provides a structured, data-driven evaluation of an active trading strategy. It demonstrates that while trade direction can be modeled with moderate success and the strategy does not appear to influence market prices in a systematic way, the execution of Maker Sell trades is a critical area for improvement. These insights offer practical next steps for refining the classification model and enhancing the overall performance of the trading strategy.\n",
